Create a page for a city to welcome all super heros to apply for residence in their city. Provide a link to a different page that will have a form with the following data:
- Name
- City or Origin
- Are you rich or have super powers?
- If you have a super power, which ones? (Flight, Speed, Invisibility, Telekenetic, Healing, Other)
- Which of the following are you? (Good, kinda good, neutral, a little evil, evil)
- Give us 3 examples of when you used your super hero abilities.

Once the data is submitted you should be sent to a page thanking applicates for their time and they will hear back from the city as soon as possible. The header and footer data between the two pages should be the same.
